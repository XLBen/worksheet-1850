'''In task_c.py write a program which:
- Asks users to enter a password which should consist of letters and numbers only. Punctuation can
be ignored â€“ the tests will not check for punctuation handling.
- Checks that the password is:
- A minimum of 8 characters long
- Contains more than 1 type of character (not just letters, not just numbers)
- If the password is valid print:
Your password is valid
- If the password is not valid print:
Your password must contain at least 8 characters, and a mix of letters and numbers
Hint: You will need to use Boolean operators and some basic string manipulation functions'''

password = input("enter the pass word :")

if len(password) >= 8 and (not password.isalnum() and not password.isalpha()) :  
    print("Your password is available")
else:
    print("Your password must contain at least 8 characters, and a mix of letters and numbers")
